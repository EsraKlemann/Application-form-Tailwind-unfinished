# Application form for energy products
Created with Vue.js 3 and Tailwind.
It sends and fetches data to a (private) Firebase realtime DB. 

The project is currently unfinished due to time restrictions. A.O. I would still like to add/improve:
- correct backgrounds on larger screen sizes.
- improve details of reactivity steps.
- continued steps of form.
- animating the appearance of a next form step.


## Project setup
